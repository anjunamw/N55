THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE ALPHA TEST OF ALL THE N55 XDFs.

MOST OF THESE XDFs ARE BASED OFF https://github.com/dmacpro91/BMW-XDFs AND I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THE BASE XDF.

TAKE EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

EVERYTHING HERE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

I started development on my F series BMW and have been attempting to define many, many more tables than the publicly available XDF

This project has the strongest XDF from the HW rev 00000D07596401

You can find my latest XDF named YYMMDD.XDF in the "Anjuna" folder.

All other XDFs are copies from the publicly available XDF repo OR slightly modified for correct units and scaling.
